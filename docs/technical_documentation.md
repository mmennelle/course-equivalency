---

## **Technical Architecture**

### **Frontend Stack**
- **Framework**: React 18+ with functional components and hooks - *Chosen for its component reusability, large ecosystem, and excellent developer experience for building interactive UIs. Functional components with hooks provide cleaner code and better performance than class components.*
- **HTTP Client**: Axios for API communication - *Selected over fetch() for its automatic JSON parsing, request/response interceptors, and built-in error handling capabilities. Provides consistent API interface across different browsers.*
- **Styling**: Custom CSS with responsive design patterns - *Custom CSS chosen over frameworks like Bootstrap to maintain full design control and avoid unnecessary bloat. Responsive patterns ensure optimal user experience across all device sizes.*
- **State Management**: React useState/useEffect hooks - *Built-in React hooks are sufficient for this application's state complexity, avoiding the overhead of Redux or other state management libraries. Keeps the codebase simple and maintainable.*
- **Authentication**: JWT token-based authentication with localStorage - *JWT tokens provide stateless authentication that scales well and localStorage enables persistent sessions across browser restarts. This approach works seamlessly with REST APIs.*
- **Search UX**: Debounced search with 300ms delay for optimal performance - *Debouncing prevents excessive API calls while typing, reducing server load and improving user experience. 300ms strikes the optimal balance between responsiveness and efficiency.*

### **Backend Stack**
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js framework - *Node.js provides excellent performance for I/O-intensive operations like database queries and API requests. Express.js offers a minimal, flexible framework that's ideal for RESTful APIs without unnecessary complexity.*
- **Database**: MySQL with connection pooling via mysql2 - *MySQL chosen for its ACID compliance and excellent support for complex relational queries needed for course equivalencies. Connection pooling via mysql2 dramatically improves performance by reusing database connections instead of creating new ones for each request.*
- **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens) with bcrypt password hashing - *JWT provides stateless authentication that scales horizontally without server-side session storage. bcrypt with 10 rounds ensures passwords are securely hashed against rainbow table attacks.*
- **Middleware**: CORS enabled, JSON body parsing - *CORS middleware enables secure cross-origin requests from the frontend application. JSON body parsing middleware automatically handles request payloads, simplifying API endpoint development.*
- **Security**: Protected routes with token verification middleware - *Centralized authentication middleware ensures consistent security across all protected endpoints. This approach prevents code duplication and reduces the risk of security vulnerabilities.*

### **Database Design**
- **Engine**: MySQL with InnoDB storage engine - *InnoDB provides ACID compliance and foreign key constraints essential for maintaining data integrity in course equivalency relationships. Its row-level locking enables better concurrent performance for multiple users.*
- **Optimization**: Strategic indexing on search fields (course_code, title, department) - *Indexes on frequently queried columns reduce search times from seconds to milliseconds for large course catalogs. Strategic placement prevents over-indexing which could slow down write operations.*
- **Relationships**: Foreign key constraints ensuring data integrity - *Foreign key constraints prevent orphaned records and maintain referential integrity between courses, departments, and equivalencies. This ensures data consistency even with concurrent operations.*
- **Scalability**: Connection pooling (10 concurrent connections, unlimited queue) - *Connection pooling dramatically reduces database connection overhead from ~500ms to ~5ms per request. The configuration balances resource usage with performance for the expected user load.*

## **Core Database Schema**

### **Primary Tables**
```sql
institutions → departments → courses → course_equivalencies
users → transfer_plans → transfer_plan_courses
```

### **Key Relationships**
- **Many-to-Many**: Delgado courses ↔ UNO courses (via equivalencies table)
- **One-to-Many**: Users → Transfer Plans → Planned Courses
- **Hierarchical**: Institutions → Departments → Courses

### **Performance Optimizations**
- Composite indexes on frequently queried columns - *Multi-column indexes enable the database to efficiently filter by multiple criteria simultaneously, essential for the course search functionality with multiple filters.*
- Unique constraints preventing duplicate equivalencies - *Database-level constraints ensure data integrity and prevent inconsistent course mappings that could confuse students. This is more reliable than application-level validation alone.*
- Soft deletes with `is_active` flags for data preservation - *Preserves historical data for audit trails and allows for easy restoration of accidentally deleted records. This approach maintains referential integrity while enabling logical deletion.*

## **API Architecture**

### **RESTful Endpoints**

#### **Course Search & Discovery**
```
GET /api/courses/search
- Query parameters: query, department, credit_hours, has_equivalency, limit, offset
- Returns: Paginated course results with equivalency indicators
- Performance: <200ms average response time with proper indexing
```

#### **Equivalency Management**
```
GET /api/courses/:courseId/equivalency
- Returns: Detailed UNO equivalent with prerequisites, notes, and transfer type
- Caching opportunity: Results rarely change, ideal for Redis caching
```

#### **Transfer Planning**
```
POST/GET/PATCH /api/transfer-plans/*
- Full CRUD operations for transfer plan management
- Authorization: JWT-protected routes ensuring user data isolation
```

### **Search Algorithm Features**
- **Multi-field search**: Course codes, titles, descriptions - *Enables intuitive search behavior where users can find courses by any identifying information, matching how students naturally think about courses.*
- **Fuzzy matching**: Handles partial course code entries (e.g., "MATH 15" finds "MATH 1550") - *Improves user experience by accommodating incomplete or imperfect search terms, reducing friction in the course discovery process.*
- **Filter aggregation**: Department, credit hours, equivalency status - *Allows students to narrow down large course catalogs efficiently, making the search process more targeted and relevant.*
- **Result ranking**: Relevance-based ordering with exact matches prioritized - *Ensures the most relevant results appear first, improving user satisfaction and reducing time spent searching for specific courses.*
